# UDP file transmission sender and receiver applications

This is a project done as a part of the [PSIA course](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/cz/education/bk/predmety/61/98/p6198306.html) at CTU FEE. Documentation of the protocol used in the project can be found [here](/docs/protocol.md). Given a lack of time during the finalization phase some code may be quite dirty.
